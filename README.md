This is a personal project made for my son, who is a Harry Potter fan.

Maths For Wizards is a maths website made using HTML, CSS and javaScript. This site is still in development as I am working on some unfinished web pages which I plan to include in the future.

I started working on this project in January 2019. It began as just a single page layout with sums and empty answer boxes for the user to input data. After making three pages, I decided to create a navigation bar so I could easily move between pages. After adding more pages, I worked on different areas for navigation including the footer, an accordion at the top of the page, and a hamburger menu. This has been a very useful way to gain experience, especially with javaScript.
